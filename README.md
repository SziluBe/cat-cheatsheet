# Category Theory Cheatsheet

A cheatsheet for the Category Theory course by SoM@UoE

Contains (pretty much, save for some repeats) every theorem, proposition, lemma, corollary, and definition from the course notes. Anything marked `Number.Number.X` is taken from the body of chapter `Number.Number`, and doesn't have it's own theorem/def/prop/lemma e.c.t. so has no specific number to reference.

This misses any content that was not examinable in 2023. Namely, Sections 6.2 onwards.
