# Category Theory Cheatsheet

A cheatsheet for the Category Theory course by SoM@UoE

Contains (pretty much, save for some repeats) every theorem, proposition, lemma, corollary, and definition from the course notes. 

This misses any content that was not examinable in 2023. Namely, Sections 6.2 onwards.
