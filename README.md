A cheatsheet for the Category Theory course by SoM@UoE

Contains (pretty much, save for some repeats) every theorem, proposition, lemma, corollary, and definition from the course notes. Anything marked `Number.Number.X` is taken from the body of chapter `Number.Number`, and doesn't have it's own theorem/def/prop/lemma e.c.t. so has no specific number to reference.

This misses any content that was not examinable in 2023. Namely, Sections 6.2 onwards.

The latest version can be found in the Releases tab or [here](https://github.com/christopherwilson/cat-cheatsheet/releases/download/latest/main.pdf).
